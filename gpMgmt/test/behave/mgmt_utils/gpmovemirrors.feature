Feature: Tests for gpmovemirrors

    Scenario: gpmovemirrors can change from group mirroring to spread mirroring
        Given a working directory of the test as '/tmp/gpmovemirrors'
        And the database is killed on hosts "mdw,sdw1,sdw2,sdw3"
        And a cluster is created with mirrors on "mdw" and "sdw1, sdw2, sdw3"
        And a sample gpmovemirrors input file is created in "spread" configuration
        And the user runs "gpmovemirrors --input=/tmp/gpmovemirrors_input_spread"
        Then gpmovemirrors should return a return code of 0
        # Verify that mirrors are functional in the new configuration
        Then verify the database has mirrors
        And all the segments are running
        And the segments are synchronized
        And save the gparray to context
        And verify that mirror segments are in "spread" configuration
        # Verify that mirrors are recognized after a restart
        When an FTS probe is triggered
        And the user runs "gpstop -a"
        And wait until the process "gpstop" goes down
        And the user runs "gpstart -a"
        And wait until the process "gpstart" goes down
        Then all the segments are running
        And the segments are synchronized

    # This scenario relies on the previous scenario to put the database in a spread mirroring configuration.
    # The order dependency isn't ideal, but to set up the cluster you basically have to go through the same process,
    # so there's no sense in duplicating effort.
    Scenario: gpmovemirrors can change from spread mirroring to group mirroring
        Given a working directory of the test as '/tmp/gpmovemirrors'
        And a sample gpmovemirrors input file is created in "group" configuration
        And the user runs "gpmovemirrors --input=/tmp/gpmovemirrors_input_group"
        Then gpmovemirrors should return a return code of 0
        # Verify that mirrors are functional in the new configuration
        Then verify the database has mirrors
        And all the segments are running
        And the segments are synchronized
        And save the gparray to context
        And verify that mirror segments are in "group" configuration
        # Verify that mirrors are recognized after a restart
        When an FTS probe is triggered
        And the user runs "gpstop -a"
        And wait until the process "gpstop" goes down
        And the user runs "gpstart -a"
        And wait until the process "gpstart" goes down
        Then all the segments are running
        And the segments are synchronized
        And the user runs "gpstop -aqM fast"

    Scenario: gpmovemirrors can move mirrors in batches
        Given a working directory of the test as '/tmp/gpmovemirrors'
        And the database is killed on hosts "mdw,sdw1,sdw2,sdw3"
        And a cluster is created with mirrors on "mdw" and "sdw1, sdw2, sdw3"
        And a sample gpmovemirrors input file is created in "spread" configuration
        And the user runs "gpmovemirrors --input=/tmp/gpmovemirrors_input_group -B 1"
        Then gpmovemirrors should return a return code of 0
        And gpmovemirrors should print "TBD" to stdout
